I am a master student at Tokyo Denki University, working with Hirokatsu Kataoka in the Akio Nakamura Lab. 

My interests lie broadly at the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and computer graphics, with a focus on 3D object recognition with point cloud. 

In my research, I tackle ways in which the automatically construction of large-scale 3D datasets based on fractal geometry.
